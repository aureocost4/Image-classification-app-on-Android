An Android project developed in Kotlin that uses a custom Tensor Flow Lite Model. 

This app can classify 3 different types of fruits using a simple neural network. You can use an image from your camera or gallery, so choose an image and it will be classified by the app, but only 3 different types of fruit can be classified so far: apple, banana and orange.
